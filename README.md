# OpenTracing Spring Tracer Configuration
This repository provides a tracer auto-configuration for Spring Boot.
The auto-configuration does following:

1. Returns tracer from `GlobalTracer`.
2. Resolves tracer from [tracerresolver](https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/java-tracerresolver).
3. If not tracer has been found it returns NoopTracer.
4. Registers tracer to GlobalTracer - if it has not been registered.

This auto-configuration is usually configured to run it no tracer bean has been provided.


## Development

```
